// COMPANY LIST
// This is the ONLY file you normally need to edit to update the site.
//
// TO ADD TODAY'S NEW HIGHLIGHT:
//   1. Save the new dashboard HTML file (exactly as generated,
//      no edits needed) into the "companies" folder.
//   2. Copy one {...} block below, paste it at the BOTTOM of the
//      list (after the last entry, before the closing "];").
//   3. Fill in the fields for the new company.
//   4. Set "file" to match the filename you saved in step 1.
//   5. Save this file and commit the change on GitHub.
//      The homepage always shows whichever entry is LAST in this
//      list, and the archive lists everything, newest first.
//
// Nothing else on the site needs to change.
